    "description": "ZOO PERFORMANCE Turbo Beanies or Turbo Blankets, are constructed using a high temperature pure carbon fibre &amp; titanium material combined with a silica insulation matting under a tight weaved outer layer and a stainless steel reinforced cage. This premium technology is heat rated to 1270 °C both internally and externally. Our new double wall design is created to reduce as much heat as possible from your engine bay and surrounding components. Turbo beanies are used to separate the turbine housing from the core. This allows the core to work with less heat strain, resulting in less of a chance of failing. The heat energy stays stored within the gas, hotter gases accelerate far better than cooler gases, so reducing the overall effect that it would have on the turbo's lifespan. Each Turbo Beanie comes with stainless steel anchoring hooks incorporated into the sheild, as well as spring clips for securing. AVAILABLE SIZES: T28, T3, T4, T6COLOURS: Carbon Fibre, Titanium",

    "description": "This is a one-of-a-kind Australian engineered and designed RB head oil drain kit, and is suitable for all RB25/26 heads including NEO. This kit has been specifically designed to help reduce a common problem of excessive oil build up in the cylinder heads. With a minimum of two securing points for additional holding strength and strain relief (using OEM fastener locations) so you DO NOT have to drill and tap, this is a direct bolt on solution. Manufactured from aircraft grade billet 6061 T6 aluminium and hard anodised black for a sleek glossy look. Our RB kit has an extremely low profile at only 45mm thick and fitted with a keyed rotational adjustment for additional strength in motorsport environments and to help route your line safely and securely. Suits AN10 ORB fittings.",

    "description": "Our GEN II GTX3576R Series turbos are manufactured specifically with a combination of the highest quality components and exquisite design with no expense spared! The dual ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our GTX series turbos are fitted with either a 9, 10 or 11 blade point milled billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing, and fitted with a sensor port. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest engineering that maximizes horsepower and boost response and are also temperature rated up to 200°C. Each turbo is fitted with an anti-surge ported-shroud compressor inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing options include V-band inlet and T3 inlet single scroll. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 0.9mm restrictor hole. We strongly recommend running an oil pressure regulator with all of our turbos.

    "description": "Our GTX5544R Series turbos are manufactured specifically with a combination of the highest quality components and exquisite design with no expense spared! The triple ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our GTX55 series turbos are fitted with an 13-blade point milled billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing, and fitted with a sensor port. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest engineering that maximizes horsepower and boost response and are also temperature rated up to 200°C. Each turbo is fitted with an anti-surge ported-shroud compressor inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing are available with a V-Band or T6 Inlet. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 1.6mm restrictor hole. We strongly recommend running an oil pressure regulator with all of our turbos.

This premium technology is heat rated to 1270 °C both internally and externally. Our new double wall design is created to reduce as much heat as possible from your engine bay and surrounding components. Turbo beanies are used to separate the turbine housing from the core. This allows the core to work with less heat strain, resulting in less of a chance of failing. The heat energy stays stored within the gas, hotter gases accelerate far better than cooler gases, so reducing the overall effect that it would have on the turbo's lifespan. Each Turbo Beanie comes with stainless steel anchoring hooks incorporated into the sheild, as well as spring clips for securing. AVAILABLE SIZES: T28, T3, T4, T6COLOURS: Carbon Fibre, Titanium",
