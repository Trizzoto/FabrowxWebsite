This premium technology is heat rated to 1270 °C both internally and externally. Our new double wall design is created to reduce as much heat as possible from your engine bay and surrounding components. Turbo beanies are used to separate the turbine housing from the core. This allows the core to work with less heat strain, resulting in less of a chance of failing. The heat energy stays stored within the gas, hotter gases accelerate far better than cooler gases, so reducing the overall effect that it would have on the turbo's lifespan. Each Turbo Beanie comes with stainless steel anchoring hooks incorporated into the sheild, as well as spring clips for securing. AVAILABLE SIZES: T28, T3, T4, T6COLOURS: Carbon Fibre, Titanium",

The dual ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our G25 series turbos are fitted with a 9-blade billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest technology maximizing horsepower and boost response and have temperature ratings of up to 200°C. The compressor housings are also fitted with a speed sensor port as well as an anti-surge compressor wheel inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing options include V-band inlet and T3 inlet single scroll. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 0.9mm restrictor hole.

The dual ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our GTX35 Mirror set turbos are fitted with a 10-blade point milled billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing, and fitted with a sensor port. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest engineering that maximizes horsepower and boost response and are also temperature rated up to 200°C. Each turbo is fitted with an anti-surge ported-shroud compressor inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing options include V-band inlet, T3 & T4 inlet single scroll. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 0.9mm restrictor hole. We strongly recommend running an oil pressure regulator with all of our turbos.

    "description": "Our GEN II GTX3582R Series turbos are manufactured specifically with a combination of the highest quality components and exquisite design with no expense spared! The dual ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our GTX35 series turbos are fitted with a 10-blade point milled billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing, and fitted with a sensor port. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest engineering that maximizes horsepower and boost response and are also temperature rated up to 200°C. Each turbo is fitted with an anti-surge ported-shroud compressor inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing options include V-band inlet, T3 & T4 inlet single scroll. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 0.9mm restrictor hole. We strongly recommend running an oil pressure regulator with all of our turbos.

    "description": "Our GTX5544R Series turbos are manufactured specifically with a combination of the highest quality components and exquisite design with no expense spared! The triple ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our GTX55 series turbos are fitted with an 13-blade point milled billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing, and fitted with a sensor port. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest engineering that maximizes horsepower and boost response and are also temperature rated up to 200°C. Each turbo is fitted with an anti-surge ported-shroud compressor inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing are available with a V-Band or T6 Inlet. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 1.6mm restrictor hole. We strongly recommend running an oil pressure regulator with all of our turbos.

    "description": "Our GTX4202RSeries turbos are manufactured specifically with a combination of the highest quality components and exquisite design with no expense spared! The dual ceramic ball bearing design provides an optimal turbo response and prolongs the lifespan of your turbo. Our GTX4202 series turbos are fitted with an 11-blade point milled billet aluminium compressor wheel with an aerodynamic tapered tip secured inside an aluminium compressor housing, and fitted with a sensor port. Our compressor wheels are designed with the latest engineering that maximizes horsepower and boost response and are also temperature rated up to 200°C. Each turbo is fitted with an anti-surge ported-shroud compressor inlet to increase surge resistance and provides reliable, continuous power. The turbine wheel is manufactured from Inconel which is a high quality super alloy and does a fantastic job at maintaining strength at high operating temperatures of up to 900°C. Our turbine housings are made from a high grade cast iron providing ultimate durability in these high performance applications. Turbine housing options are available with a T4 inlet single scroll. Each and every turbo are supplied with all the required parts such as stainless steel polished v-band clamps, flanges, water fittings, turbo drain gasket and NPT 1/4\" to -4AN turbo oil feed fitting with 1.6mm restrictor hole. We strongly recommend running an oil pressure regulator with all of our turbos.

This premium technology is heat rated to 1270 °C both internally and externally. Our new double wall design is created to reduce as much heat as possible from your engine bay and surrounding components. Turbo beanies are used to separate the turbine housing from the core. This allows the core to work with less heat strain, resulting in less of a chance of failing. The heat energy stays stored within the gas, hotter gases accelerate far better than cooler gases, so reducing the overall effect that it would have on the turbo's lifespan. Each Turbo Beanie comes with stainless steel anchoring hooks incorporated into the sheild, as well as spring clips for securing. AVAILABLE SIZES: T28, T3, T4, T6COLOURS: Carbon Fibre, Titanium",
